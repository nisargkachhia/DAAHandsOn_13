## Graph Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common graph algorithms in Python, including Topological Sort, Depth-First Search, and Kruskal's algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree.

## Directory Structure

- `algorithms/`: Contains Python files for each algorithm.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for each algorithm.
- `examples/`: Contains sample graphs used in tests.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install `unittest` if not installed (usually included with Python).
3. Run tests with:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
