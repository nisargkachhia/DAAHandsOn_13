## Graph Algorithms

This project implements three graph algorithms:
1. **Topological Sort**
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
3. **Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

## File Structure

- `algorithms/`: Contains the implementation of the algorithms.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the algorithms.
- `main.py`: Example usage and integration.

## Usage

1. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```
2. Execute examples:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
